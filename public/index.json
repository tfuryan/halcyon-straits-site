Previous Nextsads Especially for my FanFF VS body whose head is currently being painted by Komorebi Dolls. Komorebi has become my favorite faceup artist. Not only does she do beautiful work, it is also consistent and therefore a known quantity. She is however pricier than other artists who are perhaps less established or in demand. I think if I had joined the hobby before the pandemic, I would have considered more seriously commissioning international artists because there are some styles that Komorebi does not specialize in that appeal to me, like hyper realism.\nThough at this point, the number of dolls that I need painted are dwindling. I sent my ATS Doll Auriga out to Komorebi to paint, and then there are the last of the Rugged Realism boys from the Rites of Passage preorder. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what I want to do with them as they were more buy to figure out later, but a year later have remained in my box untouched. Maybe I really just love the bodies more, or maybe it\u0026rsquo;s that I like the Alphabets series better?\nIt\u0026rsquo;s hard to believe I\u0026rsquo;m only waiting on one doll, so I haven\u0026rsquo;t purchased any new resin this year, which I hope to keep up through the rest of the year. I do know that there will be some temptations along the way though. Mr Cho of Fifth Motif is working on a new body, and I just know that I will likely cave if he releases it this year. But one doll a year is not a fast clip compared to the many that I\u0026rsquo;ve acquired in my 4.5 years in this hobby.\nOne of the things I\u0026rsquo;ve done is started to cultivate more restraint and self imposed rules. I must sell a doll to make room for a new one. This helps with gauging how much I actually want this new one. A lot of wants are fleeting, and if given a cool down period, the heightened desire fades. It is very easy to get caught up in hype, as we live in a hyped up culture of consumerism. I just know that it\u0026rsquo;s temporary, and as I\u0026rsquo;ve had more dolls that don\u0026rsquo;t inspire me, I feel some regret in buying them in the first place. The goal is to limit that feeling.\nThere have been dolls that I have pined for many months, and finally made the commitment to get when the opportunity presented itself. Those types of dolls I cherish in my collection. If I try hard, I could probably scale down to 5 dolls: Neoma, Saffron, Seacan, Rai, and Aubert. Not that I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t lament getting rid of my other dolls, but those are the characters that I reach for when it comes to photographing or taking on trips/meetups. The time for that is not now, but maybe in the future a culling will ensue.\n","date":"29 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/post-05-march-2024-thoughts/","section":"Posts","summary":"This month, I\u0026rsquo;ve sewn a lot for my dolls.

It\u0026rsquo;s been almost a year since I\u0026rsquo;ve written something on this blog. The blog aspect was always a tertiary goal as I wanted to be able to create this page and have my own space where I could control the content that I created. What I can I say, the platforms really do make it easy to publish content, so most of my photos have ended up on Instagram, along with any captions with small updates.\nThis year, I have been making a greater effort to share more broadly. I grew up as a very private person, and I never published much on Facebook except for some cryptic status updates. But after my kiddo was born, I basically dropped that platform altogether. I just wasn\u0026rsquo;t getting the value out of the way interactions were happening. There was a voyeuristic quality and no real connection. I actually didn\u0026rsquo;t join Instagram fully until I joined the doll hobby and am primarily active as a curator of their lives on my profile.\nThe Discord servers that I feel comfortable speaking in are where there are small, like less than 10 people, communities. I just have never felt comfortable being in a large group. That environment tends to exacerbate my silence, so having this little space to call my own is probably where I am the most me.\nThat said, I do value and treasure connections. I have been meeting with doll collectors in person. I went to Resin Rose in 2023, and I have made plans to go again this year. I was going to say that I didn\u0026rsquo;t even make any new connections, but that\u0026rsquo;s not true. I met a few of the people that I only knew online in person. My hope for this year is to meet at least one other person that I will keep up with past the initial meeting at Resin Rose.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also purchased my next few NYC train tickets to join the NYC BJD group each month. It\u0026rsquo;s been so nice to have something to look forward too each month. I even created a YouTube video for the December 2023 Meetup. Look at me!\nAlso, I\u0026rsquo;ve restarted my sewing and released my first public pattern on Den of Angels. It was based off of a Sartoria J dress that I really liked, but knew through another collector, would not fit the Impldoll Star Model body. So I tooke it as a challenge to recreate it myself, and I\u0026rsquo;m fairly happy with the result\u0026ndash;enough to share it! It\u0026rsquo;s a small way for me to start giving back to the community, and it also gives me some accountability which is a motivating factor for me. I am definitely going to make sewing a larger part of this year\nNow that I\u0026rsquo;ve been here in Philly for some time, I\u0026rsquo;m going to try to host (well co-host) a Philly based doll meetup! And in my typical fashion, I made another flyer, though this one is less snazzy imho.\nThis year, I\u0026rsquo;m also putting my foot down on not buying any new dolls. I only have one more incoming, and I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that this will arrive in the summer. We\u0026rsquo;re only a little over two months into 2024, and I\u0026rsquo;m hoping that I will stay strong!! I will post more updates to this blog as well. Some small goals!\n","date":"6 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/post-04-updates-2024-q1/","section":"Posts","summary":"Wow!

We moved out of Texas right before the start of winter, so going out to meeting people then was a little more onerous, but with spring in full bloom, that is no longer a valid excuse. I ended up going to a doll meet up in NYC last week where I got to meet other doll collectors in person. It was lovely to be among others who enjoy the hobby and seeing their beautiful dolls in person was certainly a highlight.\nI had the fortune or misfortune of starting in the BJD hobby right before the start of the pandemic. Doll meet ups and conventions were regular events in the community, but collapsed when the world went on lockdown. Though forums and social media, I hosted my first doll meet up in Central Texas because there hadn\u0026rsquo;t been one going on that someone else was hosting. I even made a flyer.\nIt was lovely to meet local Texas doll friends, and we made plans to set up a meet the the future. Little did I know that I would be making a cross country move three months later and living in the East Coast. I messaged one of the doll collectors, Emac, that I talked with the most to inform them that I was moving and that that future doll meet up would not be hosted by me, and I hoped that it would still continue in some fashion. It turns out they also made the decision to move out of Texas to New York. I jokingly at the time mentioned that maybe we can meet up again in the future at the NYC doll meet up.\nFast forward to April 2023, I saw on their Instagram photos of the NYC doll meet up, and I promptly looked into seeing if I could attend the one in May. NYC is a couple states over, but only 90 minutes by rail, and when I checked the prices on Amtrak, a round trip ticket cost me a whopping $29. At that point, I had little excuse not to attend. The day finally came, and I decided to bring Rai since he was my most put together doll that hasn\u0026rsquo;t really gotten much interaction. Both Aubert and Seacan got to meet Sorona BJD\u0026rsquo;s boys.\nI had so much fun even though I was rather exhausted from fitting in too many social events earlier in the week. I managed to take a few photographs, but mostly I enjoyed meeting new people and catching up with Emac. Afterwards a smaller subset of us went to dinner, and that was great to just get to know each other a little better.\nPrevious Nextsads My June 2023 tickets have already been secured, so I look forward to seeing new and familiar faces. The theme will be \u0026ldquo;Hot Doll Summer\u0026rdquo;, so I\u0026rsquo;ll need to figure out who to bring and what they will wear.

More than half of my dolls have their basic profiles. The way that I have structured them is a hybrid of Den of Angel\u0026rsquo;s doll profiles and wikipedia pages for people. Of course that means that the Neoma, Saffron, Adeon, and Glaive are the most filled out because they are the core family in my doll world. Everyone else at the moment is a seed of a character. At most I have are their occupations, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t even hold true for Glaive who is \u0026ldquo;unemployed\u0026rdquo; because I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought of a better position for him.\nNext Goals # What is very glaring now that I\u0026rsquo;ve expanded all dolls that I have good photographs are to get portraits for everyone. Some dolls have details and stylings listed that are different from any photos that I have of them in my albums.

I built a simple timeline, and it works, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really give a sense of progression. Some of the charts on chartjs look interesting to try and incorporate. The radial ones especially. I made the choice to set the character\u0026rsquo;s birthday as their arrival date home to me.

I learned about the Ball Jointed Doll hobby near the end of 2019, and it has been a huge creative outlet for me. My collection consists primarily of realistic 1/3(+) scale polyurethane resin cast dolls. Since then, my collection has grown, and each doll has its own personality and character wanting to tell me their story.\nThe greatest joy in the BJD hobby is the ability to make of it what you find most fulfilling. As for the hobby microcosm, I was most drawn to photography and sewing for my dolls. Although not professional level by any means, every photo shoot and handmade outfit brings joy and satisfaction as I learn and grow.\nI share some of my experiences via YouTube videos which serves as another creative outlet. Despite only being on screen occasionally, I strive to provide informative and entertaining videos for those who are interested. This website is an extension of that as well.\nThank you for visiting, and I hope you find something here that interests you too!\nPainting of me by Emberleo entited \"A Portait of Love\" - April 2008 ","date":"1 January 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"Welcome to Halcyon Straits","summary":"Hello! ✨ I\u0026rsquo;m Ting, and I am a serial hobbyist.
