[{"content":"One of the goals that I had set out at the beginning of 2023 was to meet new people. We moved out of Texas right before the start of winter, so going out to meeting people then was a little more onerous, but with spring in full bloom, that is no longer a valid excuse. I ended up going to a doll meet up in NYC last week where I got to meet other doll collectors in person. It was lovely to be among others who enjoy the hobby and seeing their beautiful dolls in person was certainly a highlight.\nI had the fortune or misfortune of starting in the BJD hobby right before the start of the pandemic. Doll meet ups and conventions were regular events in the community, but collapsed when the world went on lockdown. Though forums and social media, I hosted my first doll meet up in Central Texas because there hadn\u0026rsquo;t been one going on that someone else was hosting. I even made a flyer.\nIt was lovely to meet local Texas doll friends, and we made plans to set up a meet the the future. Little did I know that I would be making a cross country move three months later and living in the East Coast. I messaged one of the doll collectors, Emac, that I talked with the most to inform them that I was moving and that that future doll meet up would not be hosted by me, and I hoped that it would still continue in some fashion. It turns out they also made the decision to move out of Texas to New York. I jokingly at the time mentioned that maybe we can meet up again in the future at the NYC doll meet up.\nFast forward to April 2023, I saw on their Instagram photos of the NYC doll meet up, and I promptly looked into seeing if I could attend the one in May. NYC is a couple states over, but only 90 minutes by rail, and when I checked the prices on Amtrak, a round trip ticket cost me a whopping $29. At that point, I had little excuse not to attend. The day finally came, and I decided to bring Rai since he was my most put together doll that hasn\u0026rsquo;t really gotten much interaction. Both Aubert and Seacan got to meet Sorona BJD\u0026rsquo;s boys.\nI had so much fun even though I was rather exhausted from fitting in too many social events earlier in the week. I managed to take a few photographs, but mostly I enjoyed meeting new people and catching up with Emac. Afterwards a smaller subset of us went to dinner, and that was great to just get to know each other a little better.\nPrevious Nextsads My June 2023 tickets have already been secured, so I look forward to seeing new and familiar faces. The theme will be \u0026ldquo;Hot Doll Summer\u0026rdquo;, so I\u0026rsquo;ll need to figure out who to bring and what they will wear. Cheers to having things to look foward to!\n","date":"Sun, 21 May, 2023","permalink":"/posts/post-03-meeting-new-friends/","section":"Posts","summary":"One of the goals that I had set out at the beginning of 2023 was to meet new people.

When my mind gets to a point where it wants to keep working and achieve \u0026ldquo;done\u0026rdquo;, there\u0026rsquo;s little to stop me from just keep going.\nAt this point, most of the content for my site is complete. More than half of my dolls have their basic profiles. The way that I have structured them is a hybrid of Den of Angel\u0026rsquo;s doll profiles and wikipedia pages for people. Of course that means that the Neoma, Saffron, Adeon, and Glaive are the most filled out because they are the core family in my doll world. Everyone else at the moment is a seed of a character. At most I have are their occupations, but that doesn\u0026rsquo;t even hold true for Glaive who is \u0026ldquo;unemployed\u0026rdquo; because I haven\u0026rsquo;t thought of a better position for him.\nNext Goals # What is very glaring now that I\u0026rsquo;ve expanded all dolls that I have good photographs are to get portraits for everyone. Some dolls have details and stylings listed that are different from any photos that I have of them in my albums. So mostly my work will be away from the computer and actually doing physical work to set them up for photoshoots.\nAs a data person, I really am tempted to bring some charts and visualizations on my doll collection. I built a simple timeline, and it works, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really give a sense of progression. Some of the charts on chartjs look interesting to try and incorporate. The radial ones especially. I made the choice to set the character\u0026rsquo;s birthday as their arrival date home to me. It would be interesting to see if they cluster anywhere.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s time for bed\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m sure I will have more ideas tomorrow.\n","date":"Tue, 16 May, 2023","permalink":"/posts/post-02-mostly-there/","section":"Posts","summary":"I have been tinkering with this site for what feels like 36 hours straight with small reprieves for meals and am running on a pitiful amount of sleep.","title":"Mostly There"},{"content":"Hello! ðŸ‘‹\nSo since I have some extended time for the next few weeks, I thought I would go ahead and try my hand at building a website.

I use many of the patterns available as a starting point and modify as I want changes to fit and style.\nThis section contains all my current sewing patterns for my dolls. Each page at the bottom will contain the detailed measurements that I\u0026rsquo;ve taken. Feel free to use them if it helps, but note that I am only human, and there is likely some imprecision. There is not currently a way to bulk upload measurements or share them directly on the site, so you will need to transcribe them if you want to use the measurements I\u0026rsquo;ve share.\nAll patterns are for personal use only.
