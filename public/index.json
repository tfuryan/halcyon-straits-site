I learned about the Ball Jointed Doll hobby near the end of 2019, and it has been a huge creative outlet for me. My collection consists primarily of realistic 1/3(+) scale polyurethane resin cast dolls. Since then, my collection has grown, each doll representing its own unique story and character waiting to be brought alive.\nThe greatest joy in the BJD hobby is the ability to make of it what you find most fulfilling. As a part of collecting, I was most drawn to photography and sewing for them. Although not professional level by any means, every photo shoot and handmade outfit brings joy and satisfaction.\nOn occasions, I like to share some of my experiences via Youtube videos which serves as another creative outlet. Despite only being on screen occasionally, I strive to provide informative and entertaining videos for those who are interested. This website is an extension of that as well.\nThank you for visiting, and I hope you find something here that interests you too!\nPainting of me by Emberleo entited \"A Portait of Love\" - April 2008 ","date":"Mon, 01 January, 0001","permalink":"/about/","section":"Welcome to Halcyon Straits","summary":"Hello! âœ¨ I\u0026rsquo;m Ting, and I am a serial hobbyist.","title":"About"},{"content":"Adeon Zhou - January 2023 Character Profile Age 28 Birthday Februrary 04 Gender Male Occupation Development League Basketball Player Spouse Noema Wen (divorced) Children Saffron Zhou Parents Hester Zhou (mother) Doll Profile Maker Pygmalion Dolls Head Sculpt Eita Resin Color White Body Pygmalion Dolls TEIA 71\nWhite Face-up artist DollFaced Studio Date of acquisition February 2021 Provenance Purchased second-hand on Den of Angels Eyes TianBa0830 Resin Golden Brown (Winter 2021 - No. 01) 10/5 Wig Iplehouse IHW_M082 Fiber Black 9-10\u0026quot; ","date":"Mon, 01 January, 0001","permalink":"/dolls/adeon/","section":"Dolls","summary":"My doll with the most frustrating body","title":"Adeon Zhou"},{"content":"Aubert Pierlot - April 2023 Character Profile Age 28 Birthday March 23 Gender Male Occupation Baker Doll Profile Maker Fifth Motif Head Sculpt Venitu Resin Color Copper Oriental Body Fifth Motif Timeless Body Copper Oriental Face-up artist SD Ink Date of acquisition March 2023 Provenance Purchased second-hand on Den of Angels Eyes TianBa0830 Resin Blue (Summer 2022 - No. 13) 14/5 Wig Amadiz Beauty Charlize Angora Blonde 8-9\u0026quot; ","date":"Mon, 01 January, 0001","permalink":"/dolls/aubert/","section":"Dolls","summary":"My iconic French boy doll","title":"Aubert Pierlot"},{"content":"","date":"Mon, 01 January, 0001","permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","date":"Mon, 01 January, 0001","permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","date":"Mon, 01 January, 0001","permalink":"/tags/complete/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"complete"},{"content":"One of my favorite parts of the doll hobby is the how it is a gateway to other hobbies.
