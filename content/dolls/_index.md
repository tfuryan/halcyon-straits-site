This page contains nearly all my current dolls. I attempt to provide all information about their makes, sculpts, provenance, styling, etc. I only collect legitimate/artist sanctioned dolls. If you are curious for a more inventory overview, I keep an [AirTable updated](https://airtable.com/shraC5KlzTnnafS4Z) as I order, acquire, and sell/donate my dolls.

To see more photographs, I have put together a [small gallery]({{< ref "visuals/gallery" >}}) of some of my select favorites. I also thought it might be fun to do a [timeline view]({{< ref "visuals/collection-timeline" >}}) of when I got each of my dolls.
