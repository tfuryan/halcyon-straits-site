Hello! :waving_hand:

So since I have some extended time for the next few weeks, I thought I would go ahead and try my hand at building a website. I'm trying to use Hugo and Cloudflare as a means to deploy a site. Things are going ok, and I've managed to get things to run locally. Soon enough, I hope to be able to publish. Here's to hoping that creating a static site will be more secure than WordPress. :grinning_face_with_sweat:
