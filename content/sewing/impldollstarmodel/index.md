## Measurements

---

I measured my doll as guided by [Pattern Maker Pro](https://patternmakerpro.com/manual/taking-measurements/measuring-a-model). With these measurements, you can generate slopers/blocks as well as other basic patterns. I use many of the patterns available as a starting point and modify as I want changes to fit and style.
